Some files not sent because they were empty. That is why I put image about my file architecture above.

- Arctitecture: Clean architecture but I didnt use repositories and use cases because the project is really small. 

-State anagement: Provider and Bloc which are most useful and powerful state management packages. I just wanted to show you which state management packages I use. 

-Local database: Hive which is really faster than shared preferences and sqflite.

-Equatable: Used with bloc for comparing objects.

-intl: For date forma
